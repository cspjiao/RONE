# GraphWave
## Spectral Wavelets for learning structural signatures in complex networks


This folder contains the code for GraphWave, an algorithm for computing structural signatures for nodes in a network using heat spectral wavelets. 
This code folder is organized as follows:

+ __shapes/__: contains the functions for generating (more or less) regular graphs and shapes
+ __performance_evaluation/__: functions computing different metrics for assessing the quality of the embeddings generated by GraphWave
+ __test\_perturbation\_synthetic/__: set of ipython notebooks for running the synthetic
experiments described in the paper.
+ __utils/__: set of  helper functions
+ files:
    + __characteristic\_functions.py__: functions for computing the characteristic functions.
    + __graphwave.py__: wrapper function for computing the embeddings.

### Prerequisites

GraphWave was written for __Python 2.7__ and requires the installation of the following Python libraries:


+ __networkx__: allows easy manipulation and plotting of graph objects (more information in the [Networkx website](https://networkx.github.io)).
+ __pyemd__: module for computing Earth Mover distances (for trying out other distances between diffusion distributions. More information in the [pyemd website](https://github.com/wmayner/pyemd))



Also, need standard packages: __scipy, sklearn, seaborn__ for analyzing and plotting results.

Note: heat diffusion scaling wavelets can also be computed with the Graph Signal Processing toolbox  __pygsp__ (accessible through the  [EPFL website](https://pygsp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)  ), which, beyond structural similarities, has plenty of extremely useful features for handling signals on graphs.

## Running Graphwave

A full example on how to use GraphWave is provided in the ''Using GraphWave.ipynb" of this directory.
In a nutshell:

+ input: nx (or pygsp) Graph structure
+ compute the heat wavelets
+ embed the distributions in Euclidean space using the characteristic function
+ output: signatures, which can be used in one's favorite Machine Learning framework.

For a given graph __G__ (of type pygsp or nx),GraphWave structural signatures can be simply 
computing by calling:


```
>from graphwave import graphwave

>chi,heat_print, taus=graphwave_alg(G, 'automatic', verbose=False)

```
